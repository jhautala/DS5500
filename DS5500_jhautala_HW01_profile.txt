In my most recent work experience (Programmer Analyst Sr, IDEXX) I have had the opportunity to grow my technical toolkit very broadly, in the context of a fairly autonomous, full-stack, internal software development team, designing and maintaining:
* infrastructure
* persistence
* web services
* user interfaces

My most recent academic experience has afforded two parallel paths of growth, expanding the depth and rigor of my computer science and mathematical knowledge, while also building a solid foundation in the tools and techniques of practicing data science.

I see my nascent/amateur interest in audio/visual technology and DSP as a natural extension of my interest in data science and artificial intelligence. Also, as a long time musician with a fair amount of experience in independent music production, I hope to leverage some domain knowledge to improve my productivity in analysis and modeling tasks concerned with musical audio information. That said, I look forward to learning more about less familiar domains (e.g. image/video processing, GIS, and scientific/medical measurement/assay data).
