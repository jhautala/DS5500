	Musical Audio Similarity

	The overall concept is to create a tool for exploring neighborhoods in a music library, where neighboring music would have perceptible sonic similarities. This could be useful in finding particular songs of interest, building coherent playlists, and possibly helping to prioritize manual review/evaluation for labeling/annotation. The specific features to extract and the specific applications to apply to those features are subject to further development and revision.

	Here is a rough roadmap of a possible course of development, in estimated chronological order:
		1. Feature Extraction
			harmonic information
			fundamentals (i.e. "notes")
			key
			reference pitch
			functional harmony (i.e. "chords"; these will be the primary terms/tokens)
		2. Similarity Metrics
			Jaccard Index
			Cosine Similarity
			TFIDF
		3. Applications
			Audio playback and visualization of extracted features
			Search by similarity/dissimilarity
			Playlist creation
		4. Challenges
			The primary challenge I anticipate is the prevalence of ambiguity, in everything from fundamental detection, through key identification, to the assignment of functional identities of chords. As a matter of expedience, this initial work will be primarily focused on functional harmony in the context of a twelve tone equal-tempered tuning system, but hopefully some of this development will also be extensible to a more comprehensive analytical framework.
